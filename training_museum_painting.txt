=== Woman Reading a Letter === by Johannes Vermeer
In a quiet, private moment, a young woman stands, engrossed in reading a letter. It is morning, and she is still wearing her blue nightrobe. All the other colours are subordinate to its radiant lapis lazuli; yellow and red hardly make an appearance. Vermeer rendered the different effects of the cool light precisely. For example, he was the first artist to try soft grey for flesh, and to paint the shadows on the wall light blue.

=== Fishing for Souls === by Adriaen Pietersz. van de Venne
Protestants (left) and Catholics (right) are competing for adherents by a river. The politicsal nature of the struggle between Protestants and Catholics is reflected in the presence of powerful rivals on either side. Left: Stadholder Prince Maurice and his brother Frederick Henry with their allies. On the right: Archdukes Albrecht and Isabella, who ruled the Southern Netherlands. 

=== Still Life with Cheese === by Floris Claesz. van Dijck
Food is arranged here on a costly damask tablecloth: fruit, bread, cheese. In the 17th century, this kind of painting was known as a ‘breakfast’. Vivid colours contrast with each other. Each item is carefully placed. And by viewing the table from a high angle, Van Dijck ensured that no object was obscured. This increases the sense of recession in the painting. 

===  The Art Gallery of Jan Gildemeester Jansz === by Adriaan de Lelie
In 1792, Gildemeester, a merchant, turned two large rooms at his house on Amsterdam’s Herengracht into an art gallery. Here he stands proudly at the centre of the front room, speaking with one of his guests. Visitors are examining famous paintings, including a Rembrandt - above Gildemeester’s head. The walls are completely covered in paintings, all with gilt frames. 

=== The Singel Bridge at the Paleisstraat in Amsterdam === by George Hendrik Breitner
Breitner often took photos when preparing a painting. Several preparatory photos for this painting are also known. The way the woman is walking directly towards us and the way the picture is cropped gives it a photographic feel. Originally, Breitner’s subject was a maid, but following the negative response of the art dealer who sold his work, Breitner turned her into a lady.

=== Winter Landscape with Ice Skaters === by Hendrick Avercamp

Hendrick Avercamp turned the winter landscape into a subject in its own right. A typical feature of his early work is the high horizon. This enabled Avercamp to focus on the dozens of figures on the ice. He showed all kinds of uncouth details in this bird’s-eye view, including couples making love and going to the toilet and in the distance, in the middle, a man urinating. 

=== The Threatened Swan; Interpreted later as an Allegory on Johan de Witt === by Jan Asselijn
With its wings stretched and its neck poised, the swan protects her eggs against a dog swimming nearby. Showing the scene from a low angle emphasises the bird’s power. 
The inscriptions are a later addition and have a political message. They refer to the Dutch political leader Johan de Witt, who defended the Dutch state against its many enemies.


=== Girl in a White Kimono === by George Hendrik Breitner
Inspired by Japanese prints, Breitner painted at least twelve versions of this girl in a white kimono around 1894. Each time, her pose is different and the kimono is a different colour. Here the embroidered white silk kimono with red trimmed sleeves and orange belt are what draw our attention. The dreamy girl is sixteen-year-old Geesje Kwak, a milliner who regularly modelled for Breitner.

=== Gallant Conversation, Known as ‘The Paternal Admonition’ === by Gerard ter Borch (II)
A man of the world, a soldier perhaps, is looking admiringly at the young woman in the splendid satin dress. They were once thought to be father and daughter. But perhaps the man is the woman’s suitor, and the older woman is a chaperone. The young woman’s pose, standing with her back to the viewer, emphasises the intimacy of this domestic scene.

=== The Battle of Terheide === by Willem van de Velde (I)
English ships blockaded the Dutch Republic’s harbours in 1653. While leading an attempt to break the blockade, the Dutch admiral Maarten Tromp was killed. His family commissioned this painting of his final battle to commemorate his death. It still has its original frame, featuring the heraldic arms of the Tromp family.

=== Portrait of a Girl Dressed in Blue === by Johannes Cornelisz. Verspronck
What made this such a popular portrait? That it shows a pretty child dressed in her finest clothes? As was usual at the time, the girl actually has an adult appearance. Her facial expression is all that shows she is playing the role. Unfortunately, we no longer know who she was.

=== View of Houses in Delft, Known as The Little Street === by Johannes Vermeer
An unusual painting in Vermeer’s oeuvre: a few houses and a couple of people in a quiet street. Vermeer gave the scene a palpable sense of tension and balance. The old walls, worn bricks and white plaster are almost tangible. What part of Delft this shows is no longer known.

=== Italian Landscape with a Draughtsman === by Jan Both
An artist has found a place to sketch by a wood, near a waterfall – perhaps it is Both himself. Travellers with heavy-laden mules are walking towards a plain bathed in Italian sun.
Both was clearly fascinated by the Mediterranean light and stayed in Rome for a long time. Back in the Netherlands, he continued to paint Italianate landscapes in the warm glow of the sun. 


=== The Milkmaid === by Johannes Vermeer
A maid concentrates keenly as she pours milk from a jug. It is a quiet, tranquil scene. The only movement is the flow of milk. Vermeer turned a simple composition of a prosaic subject into an intense work of art.
It is in the rendering of light that Vermeer truly excelled, painting tiny dots for highlights, as on the bread and the blue cloth.

=== Floral Still Life === by Hans Bollongier
While this ample bouquet appears quite natural, tulips, anemones, roses and carnations all have different seasons. Yet Bollongier combined them into a harmonious composition. 
This still life was painted following the financial collapse of 1637, when many lost their fortunes speculating in tulip bulbs. Perhaps this festive bouquet suggests the transience of worldly matters.

=== The Merry Family === by Jan Havicksz. Steen
IYoung and old are having a wonderful time: mother and grandmother are singing, the children are playing music and smoking, and father raises his glass. The note on the mantelpiece comments poignantly: ‘as the old sing, so pipe the young’. Steen’s picture brings the saying to life and warns the viewer: if the parents set a bad example, then the children will follow suit.

=== Still Life with a Gilt Cup === by Willem Claesz. Heda
In forty years, Willem Heda only ever painted still lifes. His paintings differ from the still lifes of his contemporaries: the colours are gentler, cooler and more harmonious. The bright yellow lemon peel is the only colour accent. 
In this work, Heda shows his skill in rendering different textures and the light reflected on these surfaces: each object on the table reflects another object.


=== The Well-stocked Kitchen, with Jesus in het House of Martha and Mary in the Background === by Joachim Bueckelaer
It is not the profusion of vegetables, fruit, meat, poultry and kitchenware displayed here by these housemaids that forms the main theme of this painting. It is Jesus visiting Mary and Martha, shown almost as an aside in the distance. The contrast between foreground and background contains the moral of the painting: do not be seduced by worldly temptation. 

=== A Windmill on a Polder Waterway, Known as ‘In the Month of July’ === by Paul Joseph Constantin Gabriël
‘Our country is colourful, juicy, fat. (...) I repeat, our country is not dull, not even in dull weather, the dunes are not dull either’, Constant Gabriël wrote in a letter. Unlike many artists of the Hague School, he preferred painting fine summer days. Here there are two: the grass, sky and windmill are all reflected in the water.

=== Portrait of Don Ramón Satué === by Francisco de Goya
Goya was well-known as a court-painter and for his idiosyncratic prints. He had already turned 76 when he painted this powerful portrait. Don Ramón was a judge in the highest tribunal of Castile. The casual pose and open collar have an informality Goya usually reserves for the portraits of his most intimate friends.

=== A Militiaman Holding a Berkemeyer, Known as the ‘Merry Drinker’ === by Frans Hals
This cheery young man is raising his glass as if to propose a toast. Although the fashion was then for intricate, detailed paintings, Hals applied his paints with quick, confident strokes. This style of painting gives the subject a real sense of movement. This is most obvious with the right hand. 

=== Still Life with Asparagus === by Adriaen Coorte
Most of Coorte’s paintings are small, intimate still lifes. With their simple subjects - asparagus, or berries - his paintings contrast starkly with the magnificent, extravagant still lifes then in vogue. Those pictures are all about the profusion of valuable objects and foods, while here the emphasis is on the meticulous rendering of a single vegetable.

=== The Fête champêtre === by Dirck Hals
Dirck Hals mostly painted people enjoying themselves, yet often included a moral message.
In this painting of an ostensibly frivolous party, the chained monkey in the foreground represents man living in sin and unable to free himself. It is an admonition to the viewer to avoid licentious behaviour. 

=== Banquet at the Crossbowmen’s Guild in Celebration of the Treaty of Münster === by Bartholomeus van der Helst
Civic guards were the city’s militia. They were volunteers. In Amsterdam, each district had its own company with its own headquarters. In the 17th century, larger and grander buildings were built. Group portraits of the members lined the walls. In 1648, Van der Helst immortalised this Amsterdam company in their hall, celebrating the peace between Spain and the Dutch Republic.

=== Children of the Sea === by Jozef Israëls
This delightful scene contains a moral. These children from a poor fishing village with their shabby clothes and broken toys, are playing out their own future. The oldest boy carries the burden of his family on his shoulders, while the boat represents the harsh life at sea.
Jozef Israëls first painted the theme in 1863. It was hugely popular and he often repeated it. 

=== River Landscape with Riders === by Aelbert Cuyp
Travellers are resting their horses in a sun-soaked river landscape. To judge from their orange shawls, they seem to be Dutch army officers. 
Cuyp saw these steep hills when he travelled along the River Rhine between Nijmegen and Cleves. It was probably the sketches he drew there that formed the basis for this painting.

=== A Mother Delousing her Child’s Hair, Known as ‘A Mother’s Duty’ === by Pieter de Hooch
A mother is inspecting her child’s hair for lice. They are in a sober Dutch interior, with Delft blue tiles and a bedstead. The chair on the right is a children’s toilet, with a built-in chamber pot. Through the door we see the back room, and catch a glimpse of the garden. These views into the distance were De Hooch’s speciality.

=== A Pelican and other Birds near a Pool, Known as ‘The Floating Feather’ === by Melchior d'Hondecoeter
Melchior d’Hondecoeter specialised in depicting birds. Here he painted a pelican, various ducks, a cassowary (left), a flamingo and an African crested crane.
D’Hondecoeter was commissioned to paint the work by Stadholder William III and his wife Mary. It was intended for Het Loo palace, where William and Mary kept a menagerie of exotic animals.


=== Portrait of a Couple, Probably Isaac Abrahamsz Massa and Beatrix van der Laen === by Frans Hals
The fabulously wealthy Haarlem merchant and his wife commissioned their friend Frans Hals to paint their portrait in an unusual way. Seventeenth-century couples rarely appear together in a single painting, especially in such a nonchalant pose. 
Hals included all kinds of symbols of love in the scene, such as the thistle on the left. A Dutch name for the plant was ‘husband’s fidelity’.


=== Self-portrait === by Rembrandt van Rijn
Despite his lack of experience, the young Rembrandt was not afraid to experiment. In this early self portrait the light brushes past his right cheek. The rest of the face is cloaked in shadow. It takes a moment to realise that the artist is staring intently, directly at the viewer. Rembrandt used the back of his brush to scratch in the wet paint, to accentuate the curls of his wild, unkempt hair.

=== Portraits of Giuliano and Francesco Giamberti da Sangallo === by Piero di Cosimo
This diptych shows a leading Florentine architect, Giuliano da Sangallo with his late father Francesco, also an architect and a musician. These are early examples of portraits in which the subject’s profession plays a key role. Here a pen and dividers suggest architecture, a melody in note form suggests music; in both disciplines, harmony and proportion are essential. 

=== Portrait of a Woman, Possibly Maria Trip === by Rembrandt van Rijn
Maria Trip, daughter of one of Amsterdam’s wealthiest merchants, was twenty when Rembrandt painted her portrait. The artist placed Maria against a stone arch and devoted particular attention to the reflected light, the fashionable dress and jewellery. The costly garments are trimmed with strips of gold lace and Maria is wearing a profusion of pearls.

=== The Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede === by Jacob Isaacksz van Ruisdael
Viewed from a low perspective, the mill contrasts majestically against the dark sky. The buildings further in the distance are the castle and St Maarten’s church at Wijk bij Duurstede, a major city in the Golden Age. The river in the foreground is the Lek. This is the epitome of a Dutch landscape: flat country, lots of water, sky and windmills.

=== Portraits of Giuliano and Francesco Giamberti da Sangallo === by Piero di Cosimo
This diptych shows a leading Florentine architect, Giuliano da Sangallo with his late father Francesco, also an architect and a musician. These are early examples of portraits in which the subject’s profession plays a key role. Here a pen and dividers suggest architecture, a melody in note form suggests music; in both disciplines, harmony and proportion are essential. 

=== The Battle of Waterloo === by Jan Willem Pieneman
Emperor Napoleon met his final defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. This painting – the largest at the Rijksmuseum – shows the moment when the tide turned: the British general Wellington hears that the Prussian army is approaching. Victory, and an end to twenty years of war, is at hand. The Dutch crown prince, later Willem II, lies wounded on a stretcher. For his courage in the field, he was known as the Hero of Waterloo. 

=== The Sampling Officials of the Drapers’ Guild === by Rembrandt van Rijn
Samplers checked the quality of dyed cloth. Here Rembrandt shows them at work, distracted for a moment and looking up. One syndic is about to sit, or stand, so not all the heads are at the same level. A clever trick which, with the confident brushwork and subtle use of light, make this one of the liveliest group portraits of the 17th century. Originally painted for the sampling hall (Staalhof), in 1771 it was acquired by Amsterdam’s town hall.

=== Night Watch, Militia Company of District II under the Command of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq === by Rembrandt van Rijn
Rembrandt’s largest, most famous canvas was made for the Arquebusiers guild hall. This was one of several halls of Amsterdam’s civic guard, the city’s militia and police. 
Rembrandt was the first to paint figures in a group portrait actually doing something. The captain, dressed in black, is telling his lieutenant to start the company marching. The guardsmen are getting into formation. Rembrandt used the light to focus on particular details, like the captain’s gesturing hand and the young girl in the foreground. She was the company mascot.


=== St Odulphuskerk in Assendelft === by Pieter Jansz. Saenredam
Once a Catholic church, St Odulphus’s passed into Protestant hands at the start of the Dutch Revolt against Spain. The artist shows a service taking place. Worshippers are listening to the preacher on the right in the pulpit. Sermons are the main feature of a Protestant service. 
Saenredam came from Assendelft: his family name appears on a tombstone in the foreground. 

=== The Jewish Bride === by Rembrandt van Rijn
It seems that Rembrandt painted his subjects as the biblical couple, Isaac and Rebecca. Its popular name, the Jewish Bride, is a later invention.
The portrait is painted with an extraordinarily free hand, as in the sleeve, where the paint is especially thick and shaped to reflect the light.

=== Self-portrait as the Apostle Paul === by Rembrandt van Rijn
Here, Rembrandt is about 55. In this portrait he represents St Paul, the apostle, identified by his usual attributes: a manuscript and a sword, of which the hilt extends from under the cloak.
The self portrait is typical of Rembrandt’s late style of painting: he used the paint structure in the composition, as in the folds of the turban for example.

=== The Sick Child === by Gabriël Metsu
A worried mother looks at her young daughter, slumped listlessly on her lap. Metsu chose an unusual subject, since depictions of poorly children are rare in 17th-century art. 
Perhaps he intended the mother to personify charity, Caritas. Then the picture of the Crucifixion on the wall would be a specific reference to Christ, who died for the love of Man on the Cross.

=== Portrait of William I, Prince of Orange === by Adriaen Thomasz. Key
Of all the nobles in the Low Countries to join the revolt against the Spanish crown, the foremost was William of Orange (1533-1584). Raised at the court of Charles V, he was a consummate diplomat: hence his nickname, the Silent. He emerged as the leader of the insurrection against Spain. In 1580, Philip II put a price on his head; four years later, he was assassinated.

=== Self-portrait === by Vincent van Gogh
After he heard his brother Theo describe the new colourful style of French art, Vincent decided in 1886 to move to Paris. He soon began experimenting with the new idiom in a series of self portraits. This was mainly to spare the expense of using models. Here he painted himself as a debonnaire Parisian, with loose, regular brushstrokes in striking colours.

=== Portrait of a Member of the Van der Mersch Family === by Cornelis Troost
The portrait conveys a sense of convivial hospitality, as if the man were inviting us into his home to enjoy his art and music. In a typically 18th-century way, the portrait has no sense of distance, of authority. It introduces us directly to the open personality of this enthusiastic young member of a wealthy Baptist family from Amsterdam. He was not expecting visitors: there are a few specks on his shoulder from when he powdered his wig. 

=== Portrait of Alida Christina Assink === by Jan Adam Kruseman
Dressed to the nines in the latest fashion, Alida Assink poses here for Kruseman, the society artist. Her clothes give her a fashionable shape: with her wide shoulders, puffed sleeves and hooped skirt, her waist seems tiny. The large belt clasp draws even more attention to her midriff. Kruseman was an admirer of British portraiture: the country setting, with hunting dog and garden vase are all borrowed from English examples.

=== Piano Practice Interrupted === by Willem Bartel van der Kooi
A native of Friesland, artist Van der Kooi specialised in painting children. The children in this painting are shown in a playful, spontaneous pose. It could almost be a snapshot. Yet appearances are deceptive. The artist arranged the children deliberately to form a triangular composition. And we no longer know if this is a genuine portrait or an imaginary scene.

=== The First Day of School === by Jean Baptiste Vanmour
A mother brings her daughter to school on her first day, followed by an entourage of women. They are evidently Turkish Muslims, since the dress code allowed them colourful clothes and yellow shoes, unlike non-Muslims. A servant is carrying the girl’s embroidery frame. Handicraft was a favourite occupation of women in wealthy Turkish circles. Slaves did the household chores. 

=== Italian Landscape with Umbrella Pines === by Hendrik Voogd
Voogd was known as the Dutch Claude, after the French painter Claude Lorrain, who was famous for his historical landscapes bathed in a golden glow. Voogd depicted the garden at Villa Borghese in Rome late in the afternoon: the sun casts long shadows and the trees stand out starkly against the sky. People are promenading, enjoying the wonderful sunset. In the foreground, an artist sits, leaning against a tree, sketching.

=== Portrait of Gerard Andriesz Bicker === by Bartholomeus van der Helst
Bartholomeus van der Helst portrayed both Bickers, father and son. The difference between the two generations is striking. The father is dressed in sober black, wearing an old-fashioned millstone ruff. His son Gerard - here about twenty - appears in a colourful, flamboyant costume, with a flat collar and fashionable shoes.

=== View of Olinda, Brazil === by Frans Jansz Post
Tempted by Brazil’s sugar plantations, in the 1630s the Dutch captured much of Portugal’s colony on South America’s western coast. They were forced to withdraw in the 1650s.
Frans Post went to Brazil from 1636 to 1644 to sketch and paint the country and its inhabitants. Back in the Netherlands, he continued to paint real and imaginary Brazilian landscapes.


=== View of the Golden Bend in the Herengracht === by Gerrit Adriaensz. Berckheyde
Here we see the canal as it was, shortly before 1672. The crisis that would mark that year had yet to break, and construction is proceeding apace. One house in the background is wrapped in scaffolding; at the start of Spiegelstraat workers are laying paving stones, while building materials lie round about. These decorative yet stark, classical buildings appear here to their best advantage.

=== Square Man === by Karel Appel
The square man squeezes with difficulty into this square canvas. He seems to squint slightly with his red and green eyes and his blue mouth gapes open. The head is too big, the body is too small, and the arms and legs are too short, yet with his fiercely coloured body and his ponderous genitals, he manages to shock everyone who sees him.

=== Girl in a Large Hat === by Caesar Boëtius van Everdingen
This woman with her wide sunhat and seductive, bared shoulder is similar to the enticing shepherdesses that often appear in Dutch paintings. She proffers a small basket of fruit to the viewer in an unmistakably erotic gesture. The picture was originally intended to be displayed high on a wall, above a door or mantelpiece. That is why she looks down at us. 

=== Javanese Court Officials === by anonymous
Clothes make the man, so too in Indonesia. These are not actual portraits, but types. In addition to revealing the region these men come from, the meticulously painted clothes and batik motifs also provide information about their rank and status.
These proud, confident figures are unusual: in Western pictures, Indonesians were usually portrayed as hostile, subservient or as unspoilt savages.

=== Adolf and Catharina Croeser, Known as ‘The Burgomaster of Delft and his Daughter’ === by Jan Havicksz. Steen
Legs spread, hand on hip, Croeser sits comfortably on the stoop of his house on Oude Delft in Delft. His 13-year-old daughter Catharina is looking directly at us. Jan Steen added a narrative element to the portrait: paupers asking the wealthy grain merchant for alms.
Two years later, in 1657, Croeser acted as guarantor for Steen, who was then deeply in debt.
